# PIE-smFRET-toolkit
Toolkit for single-molecule FRET (smFRET) experiments using Time-Correlated Single Photon Counting (TCSPC) data in PTU format (T3 data, PicoQuant). The scripts support pulsed-interleaved excitation (PIE) of two wavelengths and two detection channels, i.e., donor and acceptor excitations and corresponding detection channels.

Required Python packages:

- numpy 
- matplotlib
- pandas
- openpyxl
- json
- alive_progress

Usage:

Use the scripts according to there name from S0 to S3. User input like, e.g., channel assignments or filter settings, is required in the parameter section in each script.
