# PIE-smFRET-toolkit
Toolkit for single-molecule FRET (smFRET) experiments using Time-Correlated Single Photon Counting (TCSPC) data in PTU format (T3 data, PicoQuant). The scripts support pulsed-interleaved excitation (PIE) of two wavelengths and two detection channels, i.e., donor and acceptor excitations and corresponding detection channels.

Required Python packages:

numpy
matplotlib
pandas
openpyxl
json
alive_progress
