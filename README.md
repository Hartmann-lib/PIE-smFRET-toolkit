# PIE-smFRET-toolkit
Toolkit for single-molecule FRET (smFRET) experiments using Time-Correlated Single Photon Counting (TCSPC) data in T3 format (PicoQuant). The scripts support pulsed-interleaved excitation (PIE) of two excitation wavelengths and two detection channels, i.e., donor and acceptor excitations and detection channels.
